# calculator_sort

This program is meant to run on the CASIO fx-CG50 calculator. The purpose of this program is to replicate the working of sorting algorithms seen in videos on platforms like YouTube so that users can watch them on the calculator, especially during downtime in class.

## algorithms

There are several different algorithms that you can choose. Initially, the program asks you to input a number corresponding to a particular algorithm:

- 1 - Bubble sort
- 2 - Cocktail sort
- 3 - Selection sort
- 4 - Insertion sort
- 5 - Shell sort
- 6 - Quick sort
- 7 - Merge sort
- 8 - Comb sort
- 9 - Heap sort
- 10 - Radix sort

## modes

After selecting the algorithm, you need to choose the mode. The mode represents the initial conditions of the list of numbers to be sorted:

- 1 or '' - numbers from 1 to 192 evenly distributed and shuffled
- 2 - numbers from 1 to 192 randomly distributed
- 3 - numbers from 1 to 192 evenly distributed and sorted in reverse order
- 4 - numbers from 1 to 192 evenly distributed and sorted
